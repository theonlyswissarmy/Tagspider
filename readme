Just found out about musicbrainz picard - which seems like a much better version of this.

Tagspider is a mass media tagging tool, done minimally, uses the musicbrainz api to assign various bits of metadata to a piece of music. 

Works by using already existing metadata from the song, and tries to decipher what it can from the title of the file uploaded

Right now this still kinda sucks, I've been using python more and more, I might switch over to that

Recently I made the decision to destroy the entire framework of the resttemplate to try to switch over to a new API

this was a bad call, the entire thing didn't work, I need to redo everthing 

it's so over

STILL TO DO:
entire folder function still isn't working
See if theres a way to use Last.fm api in anyway
