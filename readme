Just found out about musicbrainz picard - which seems like a much better version of this.

Tagspider is a mass media tagging tool, done minimally, uses the musicbrainz api to assign various bits of metadata to a piece of music. 

Works by using already existing metadata from the song, and tries to decipher what it can from the title of the file uploaded

STILL TO DO:
entire folder function still isn't working
See if theres a way to use Last.fm api in anyway
